            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p class="color">Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is the space agency of India. The organisation is
                involved in science, engineering and technology to harvest the benefits of outer space for India and the
                mankind. ISRO is a major constituent of the Department of Space (DOS), Government of India. The
                department executes the Indian Space Programmeprimarily through various Centres or units within ISRO.

                ISRO was previously the Indian National Committee for Space Research (INCOSPAR), set up by the
                Government of India in 1962, as envisioned by Dr. VikramA Sarabhai. ISRO was formed on August 15, 1969
                and superseded INCOSPAR with an expanded role to harness space technology. DOS was set up and ISRO was
                brought under DOS in 1972.

                The prime objective of ISRO/DOS is the development and application of space technology for various
                national needs. To fulfil this objective, ISRO has established major space systemsfor communication,
                television broadcasting and meteorological services; resources monitoring and management; space-based
                navigation services. ISRO has developed satellite launch vehicles, PSLV and GSLV, to place the
                satellites in the required orbits.</p>
